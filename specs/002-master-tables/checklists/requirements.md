**Feature**: 002-master-tables  
**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft

## Content Quality

### Technology-Agnostic Language

- [x] **No Database Implementation Details**: Spec does not mention Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL schemas, or SQL queries
- [x] **No API Implementation Details**: Spec does not mention tRPC routers, endpoints, or API structure
- [x] **No UI Implementation Details**: Spec does not mention shadcn/ui components, TailwindCSS classes, or React specifics
- [x] **No Framework References**: Spec does not mention Next.js, App Router, or framework-specific patterns
- [x] **Focus on User Value**: All requirements describe WHAT users can do and WHY it matters, not HOW it's implemented

### Clarity and Testability

- [x] **All Functional Requirements Testable**: Each FR can be validated with a clear pass/fail test
- [x] **No Ambiguous Language**: Requirements avoid words like "generally", "usually", "might", "should consider"
- [x] **Specific Constraints Defined**: All validations specify exact rules (e.g., "unique within user's account list", "case-insensitive")
- [x] **Edge Cases Documented**: All identified boundary conditions have documented expected behavior
- [x] **Success Criteria Measurable**: All SC items specify concrete metrics (time, count, percentage) or observable outcomes

---

## Requirement Completeness

### User Scenarios

- [x] **All Stories Prioritized**: Each user story has P1, P2, or P3 priority with justification
- [x] **Independent Testability Confirmed**: Each story can be tested standalone and delivers value independently
- [x] **Priority Justification Clear**: Each priority level has clear explanation of why it's more/less critical
- [x] **Acceptance Scenarios Comprehensive**: Each story has 1-6 acceptance scenarios covering happy path and key variations
- [x] **Given/When/Then Format**: All acceptance scenarios follow proper Given/When/Then structure

### Functional Requirements

- [x] **CRUD Operations Covered**: All five entities (Accounts, Categories, Payees, Currencies, Settings) have Create, Read, Update, Delete requirements
- [x] **Data Validation Specified**: Requirements define uniqueness, format, and referential integrity rules
- [x] **Soft Delete Addressed**: Archival behavior documented for entities that shouldn't be hard deleted
- [x] **Default Seeding Documented**: Requirements specify what data is pre-populated (EUR currency, default categories)
- [x] **Audit Trail Requirements**: All entities include createdAt/updatedAt timestamp requirements

### Edge Cases

- [x] **Deletion with Dependencies**: Spec addresses what happens when deleting entities with related data
- [x] **Duplicate Handling**: Spec defines validation and error messages for duplicate names
- [x] **Currency Changes**: Spec addresses currency modification after transactions exist
- [x] **Missing Data Scenarios**: Spec addresses empty states (no categories, no settings record)
- [x] **Stale Data Handling**: Spec addresses outdated exchange rates

### Key Entities

- [x] **All Entities Defined**: Account, Category, Payee, Currency, Settings all documented
- [x] **Attributes Listed**: Each entity has key attributes described (without implementation details)
- [x] **Relationships Described**: Foreign key relationships explained in business terms
- [x] **Enums Specified**: All enumerated types defined (account type, category type, theme, payee type)

### Success Criteria

- [x] **All SC Items Measurable**: Each criterion has specific metric or observable outcome
- [x] **Performance Targets Set**: Time-based criteria specified (30s account creation, 2s feedback, 500ms validation)
- [x] **User Experience Metrics**: Usability criteria defined (5 min account setup, 50 categories without degradation)
- [x] **Data Integrity Criteria**: Zero orphaned records criterion included
- [x] **Design Consistency**: Liquid Glass design language adherence specified

---

## Feature Readiness

### Clarifications

- [x] **Maximum 3 Clarifications**: Spec contains 3 or fewer [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- [x] **Clarifications Are Critical**: Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers block implementation progress
- [x] **Alternatives Provided**: Each clarification offers 2-3 specific options for user selection

**Current Clarification Count**: 0  
**Status**: ✅ PASS (No ambiguous requirements found)

### Dependencies

- [x] **Foundation Phase Complete**: Spec confirms Foundation Phase (001-foundation) is operational
- [x] **External Dependencies Listed**: Database, infrastructure, and tooling dependencies documented
- [x] **Blocking Dependencies Clear**: Dependencies marked as must-be-complete vs. nice-to-have

### Scope Control

- [x] **Out of Scope Section Exists**: Explicit list of deferred features documented
- [x] **Future Enhancements Identified**: Clear distinction between MVP and future phases
- [x] **Assumptions Documented**: Known constraints and design decisions listed

## Validation Results

### Initial Assessment

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS (10/10 items)  
**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS (24/24 items)  
**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS (9/9 items)

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Summary**: All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, technology-agnostic, and ready to proceed to the planning phase (/speckit.plan).

---

## Notes

This checklist validates the specification against SpecKit quality standards. All items should be checked ([ ] → [x]) during validation. Any unchecked items require spec updates before proceeding to planning phase.

**Validation Completed**: 2025-10-24  
**Result**: 43/43 items passed (100%)  
**Clarifications Required**: None  
**Iterations**: 1 (first-pass success)

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Review spec against each checklist item - COMPLETE
2. ✅ Update spec for any failed checks - NOT NEEDED (all passed)
3. ✅ Resolve any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - NOT NEEDED (none found)
4. ✅ Mark overall status as READY - COMPLETE
5. ⏭️ Proceed to planning phase with /speckit.plan

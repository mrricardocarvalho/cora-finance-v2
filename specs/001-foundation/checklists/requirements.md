# Specification Quality Checklist: Foundation Phase

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED (with infrastructure feature caveat)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **INFRASTRUCTURE EXCEPTION**: Foundation phases reference Constitution-mandated technologies but focus on developer experience outcomes
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Treats developers as users, focuses on setup time and environment reliability
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Written for developer stakeholders (appropriate for infrastructure feature)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User scenarios, requirements, success criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR can be verified objectively
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SCs include specific time/percentage metrics
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Focus on outcomes (setup time, startup time, error counts)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 4 user stories with comprehensive Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Database connectivity, missing env vars, port conflicts, version mismatches
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Limited to project initialization, excludes feature development
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Developer environment prerequisites documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each FR maps to testable user story scenarios
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Setup (P1), Quality (P2), Testing (P3), CI (P4) progression
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 10 specific, measurable outcomes
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Updated to reference "type-safe API layer" not "tRPC", "styling framework" not "TailwindCSS 4.x"

## Notes

**Special Case - Infrastructure Feature**: This is a foundation/infrastructure feature where:

- "Users" are developers (not end-users)
- "Value" is a working development environment
- Some technical references are unavoidable but have been minimized to focus on capabilities and outcomes
- Constitution v1.0.0 explicitly mandates specific technologies for this project

**Recommendation**: ✅ Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase

**Rationale**: While infrastructure specs inherently reference technical components, this spec successfully:

1. Focuses on developer experience (setup time, error clarity, automation)
2. Defines measurable success criteria (time, coverage, error counts)
3. Prioritizes user stories by development workflow importance
4. Maintains testability and clear acceptance criteria

# Feature Specification: Foundation Phase

**Feature Branch**: `001-foundation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Set up the entire project environment with the defined tech stack. Include: Folder structure, Base configuration files, Database setup, API initialization, Global layout using the Liquid Glass design language, Example environment variables, Automated quality workflows, Example tests, README update"

**Note**: This is an infrastructure feature where developers are the primary users. While the specification references technical components mandated by the Constitution v1.0.0, it focuses on developer experience and measurable setup outcomes rather than implementation details.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Developer Environment Setup (Priority: P1)

A developer clones the Cora Finance v2 repository for the first time and needs to get a working development environment running with all dependencies, configuration, and database connectivity verified.

**Why this priority**: Foundation is the absolute prerequisite for all future development. Without a properly configured environment, no features can be built or tested. This is the critical path blocker.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the setup commands and verifying that the application starts, connects to the database, and displays a minimal UI with Liquid Glass styling. Success is achieved when a developer can see "Hello Cora Finance" rendered with glass morphism effects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh clone of the repository, **When** developer runs `npm install`, **Then** all dependencies install without errors and package.json scripts are available
2. **Given** dependencies are installed, **When** developer copies `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configures database credentials, **Then** environment variables are loaded correctly
3. **Given** environment is configured, **When** developer runs database migration command, **Then** PostgreSQL schema is created successfully
4. **Given** database is ready, **When** developer runs `npm run dev`, **Then** application starts on localhost and displays a landing page with Liquid Glass design
5. **Given** application is running, **When** developer accesses the tRPC endpoint health check, **Then** API responds with connection confirmation

### User Story 2 - Code Quality Validation (Priority: P2)

A developer makes changes to the codebase and needs to verify that their code meets quality standards (TypeScript strict mode, linting, formatting) before committing.

**Why this priority**: Ensures code quality from day one and prevents technical debt. This is secondary to having a working environment but critical before any real feature development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally introducing a type error or linting violation, running the quality check commands, and verifying they catch the issues. Success when all quality gates pass on clean code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes are made, **When** developer runs `npm run lint`, **Then** ESLint reports any code style violations
2. **Given** code changes are made, **When** developer runs `npm run type-check`, **Then** TypeScript compiler reports any type errors in strict mode
3. **Given** code with formatting issues, **When** developer runs `npm run format`, **Then** code is automatically formatted according to project standards
4. **Given** properly formatted and typed code, **When** all quality commands run, **Then** no errors or warnings are reported

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Testing Execution (Priority: P3)

A developer needs to run the test suite to verify that their changes haven't broken existing functionality and that new code is properly tested.

**Why this priority**: Testing infrastructure is essential but can be validated after basic environment and quality checks work. Enables TDD workflow required by constitution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the example test suite and verifying it executes successfully. Success when tests run, pass, and generate coverage reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** test suite is configured, **When** developer runs `npm run test`, **Then** Jest executes all unit tests and reports results
2. **Given** test suite completes, **When** coverage report is generated, **Then** coverage metrics are displayed and meet minimum thresholds
3. **Given** E2E tests are configured, **When** developer runs `npm run test:e2e`, **Then** Playwright executes browser tests against the running application
4. **Given** tests fail, **When** developer views test output, **Then** clear error messages indicate what failed and why

---

### User Story 4 - Continuous Integration Verification (Priority: P4)

When a developer pushes code to GitHub, automated workflows need to verify build success, test passage, and code quality without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Automates quality gates but is lowest priority since it depends on all other stories working locally first. Ensures team-wide consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by pushing a commit and observing GitHub Actions execute successfully. Success when CI pipeline runs all checks and reports status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code is pushed to GitHub, **When** CI workflow triggers, **Then** dependencies install successfully in the CI environment
2. **Given** CI environment is ready, **When** workflow runs build step, **Then** TypeScript compiles without errors
3. **Given** build succeeds, **When** workflow runs test step, **Then** all tests execute and pass
4. **Given** tests pass, **When** workflow runs lint step, **Then** code quality checks pass
5. **Given** all checks complete, **When** workflow finishes, **Then** GitHub shows green check mark on commit

### Edge Cases

- What happens when PostgreSQL is not running or database credentials are incorrect? System should display clear error message indicating database connection failure with troubleshooting steps.
- What happens when environment variables are missing from `.env.local`? Application startup should fail gracefully with specific error indicating which variables are required.
- What happens when incompatible Node.js version is used? Package manager should warn about version mismatch based on engines field.
- What happens when port 3000 is already in use? Development server should either suggest alternative port or allow configuration via environment variable.
